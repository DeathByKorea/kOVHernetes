# kOVHernetes

![kOVHernetes][logo]

kOVHernetes (*`kovh`*) is a command-line utility for managing [Kubernetes][k8s] clusters on the [OVH Cloud][ovhcloud]
platform.

It deploys cloud instances running the [CoreOS Container Linux][cont-linux] operating system with Kubernetes components
pre-configured using [Ignition][ignition], including a [flannel][flannel] overlay network for containers.

## Prerequisites

### Runtime

[Python][python] interpreter (version 3.2 or above) with the [`setuptools`][py-setuptools] package.

Additionally on **Linux**:

* [`cryptography`][py-cryptography] package
  * provided by the `python3-cryptography` OS package
  * installed from source, see [Building cryptography on Linux][cryp-req]

### Cloud provider

* At least one Cloud project must be created before resources can be provisioned by kOVHernetes.
* The Cloud project must be associated with a vRack in order to create Private Networks.
* At least one SSH public key must have been added to the project.

## Disclaimer

kOVHernetes is a toy project written for testing purposes. It is **not** supported by [OVH][ovh] in any manner.

Although I strive to enforce a [reasonably high level of security][security] by default, no security audit has been
performed on this software or the elements of infrastructure it helps to generate.

**Use at your own risk**.

## Roadmap

* [ ] `list` command to display clusters
* [ ] Master HA
